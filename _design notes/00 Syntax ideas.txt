Notemark is not an HTML markup language!

The markup language should not assume any help from a parser so you should be able to just type into a simple text editor and have it be usable and fast.

General rules:
White space can be used between a symbol and its text but it is not required. This is a convention that should be followed when creating extensions.

Definitions

::Term
Definition

Must be start of line. Review words can be built using definitions.

!!Idea
A random idea or thought you have during a note taking session.

Session marker

&&Session

&&Lecture 00 

A mark to denote a new note taking session. This  allows you to organize your notes by lecture numbers in the same or different files; whichever way makes more sense to you.

DD Date and/or time
must be start of line. This would allow for automatic addition of date time by a parser (when it's done) but still allow the user to manually enter it.


Headings.
I'm torn on stealing markdown's markup for this. I tend to not like it but it is really simple and clear.

# Heading
All headings must be start of line.

##Sub-heading

### Sub-sub-heading

####Etc.


$$$Default math markup language
The parser can set a default language but you can also specify one.
Must be start of line.


$$ math $$
Math can be anywhere in the text.
Should be extensible so you can use whatever math markup you want.
Line feeds are fine.


*italic*
Can be anywhere.


**bold**
Can be anywhere.


new line
Want a new line? Press bloody return! No stupid double spaces.


Paragraph
There is no "paragraph" marker because the whole concept of making a special indicator for a paragraph is not needed since this is not an HTML markup language. If you want a paragraph use two carriage returns just like you normally would when you type.


ListName:
* item 1
* item 2

Notice there is no need to have a blank line like in Markdown but the colon is required(?).
Must be start of line.


??Question
A term or question to research after the note taking session is done.


?!Review Question
Answer.

A study question you create after your note taking session based on your notes. You can easily convert your lecture questions to review questions but you don't have to.
Must be start of line.

One use for this could be the generation of flash cards from review questions and terms.


Links: 
Shamelessly steal Markdowns markup?  I think I can simplify this over Markdown but for now...


Might not add links at first since the focus is taking notes not building webpages. But what about images/drawings? I think it is imperative to have images.



[Text](http://url)
A web Link. 
Links don't have to start on a line.


[Text] blah blah [Text].
If you use a link a lot you can just use brackets then define the link later...

[Text]: http://url "Title (optional)"


<http://mikbe.tk>
Automatic link.


[Text]()
Implicit link using the name.


![Image](/path/to/image)
An image link. Identical to text links in their formatting. Can also link to a web image. 

![Image]()
Implicit image. Will automatically map to common image types.


Source code markup:

@@language
source code
@@
Denotes a code block.

What about \\ as code markup instead of @@?


@@@default language
Allows code blocks without specifying language.
Multiple default languages can be used and the last one used will be parsed.


`Inline code`

Will use last default language if no default inline is specified.

@`default inline language
Not sure if I should have this.





Backslash Escapes:
To force a literal character use a backslash: "\".
