Should allow person to just take notes without complicated bullshit.

for instance as you're typing to mark something as a definition you could use ::

something I want to define:: the definition

What should the view output be? Sure there could be multiple outputs but there needs be a default. I'm thinking HTML since there are lots of HTML parsers already and it's cross platform. The only other choice I can think of is rich text and I'm not sure if I want that.

IT SHOULD NOT BE AN HTML MARKUP LANGUAGE!

Output type should not influence markup design since there should be multiple formats.

What about PDF for output?
Maybe for printing but not for live editing since it isn't a dynamic editing format and it is fairly unfriendly to editing.

Should it support Windows? If I can do it easily sure but not if I can't.

What if I use Redcar as the base text editor? Except I need HTML display.

WYSIWYG editing.
Eventually I want to be able to type in markup and have it be displayed as parsed text. I think this will require me to build my own text input/display control.

Don't be afraid to shamelessly steal ideas from Markdown but avoid the annoying syntax like double spaces for new lines.

Important/Lookup later.

Markup language parser should be easily extendible. 

The markup should be a spec without any thought to what language implements it.

Mathematical notation (e.g. LaTeX, Maple, etc.)

Vim or Emacs keyboard short cuts with EASY spellcheck and speech.

Why not use Vim?
Vim isn't suitable because you should always be in insert mode and switching is a major mental stopper. It grinds me to a halt mentally when I have to keep switching back and forth. Also I hate the scripting language in Vim.

Drawings
What if the user app/note taking app allowed the use of a drawing pad like a Wacom? When you start drawing on the pad it automatically adds a picture element. Should also allow you to easily name the drawing.
